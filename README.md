# Mood-lamp-using-Arduino

This project aims to implement a mood lamp that we can see in everyday life using an Arduino kit.Â    
We will use RGB multicolor to show a diverse color set for the user.   

* Set up Arduino
    * Download Arduino program and set environment for window 64.

* Compose PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
     * Compose the PCB (printed circuit board) as above.
     * Use one led lantern and three resistors to control RGB colors.
 
* Programming
     * Program Arduino system
     * Use random function to implement diverse color visually.
     * Check the color set and search how many colors Arduino can make.
     * Arduino will show random variables which it used for parameters.
 
* Test and review
     * Test Arduino program and check the colors

# Mood_lamp-Arduino

This project aims to implement a mood lamp that we can see in everyday life using an Arduino kit.Â    
We will use RGB multicolor to show a diverse color set for the user.   

* Set up Arduino
    * Download the Arduino program and set the environment for Windows 64.

* Compose PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
     * ![image](https://github.com/ijaejun1025/Mood_lamp-Arduino/assets/154036705/c3f67a1b-5e9a-4016-83f7-b4e23ee4d737)
     * Compose the PCB (printed circuit board) as above.
     * Use one LED lantern and three resistors to control RGB colors.
 
* Programming
     * Program Arduino system
     * Use a random function to implement diverse colors visually.
     * Check the color set and search for how many colors Arduino can make.
     * Arduino will show random variables that it uses for parameters.
 
* Test and review
     * Test the Arduino program and check the colors.

# Mood-lamp-using-Arduino

This project aims to implement a mood lamp that we can see in everyday life using an Arduino kit.Â    
We will use RGB multicolor to show a diverse color set for the user.   

By implementing the basic lamp program, we can understand how Arduino works and how to code the Arduino programming for the stuff in real life.
